> ## 1-What is an EC2 Instance?
>
> EC2 allows users to rent virtual machines on the cloud, which can be used to run applications, host websites, or perform various computing tasks
>
> ## 2- Name 2 use cases for EC2.
>
> * Run cloud-native and enterprise applications
> * Scale for HPC applications
> * Develop for Apple platforms
>
> ## 3- Provide 1 reason to use ECS instead of a service such as Heroku, Digital Ocean, or Render.com.
>
> ECS offers more control over the infrastructure and seamless integration with other AWS services, making it suitable for applications with specific requirements and existing AWS setups
>
> ## 4- Where can we find EC2 on the AWS Console?
> 
> Compute section
>
> ## 5- Explain the general difference between T2 Micro and XL.
>
> T2 Micro instances have lower baseline and less memory, making them suitable for smaller applications and low-traffic websites ,they are cost-effective options for lightweight workloads.
> T2 XL instances have higher baseline and more memory, making them ideal for larger-scale applications, databases, data processing, and resource-intensive tasks.
>
> ## 6- Explain a “Compute Cycle” to a non-technical friend.
>
> its the processing that computer performed to do a task
> 
> ## 7- What is Elastic Beanstalk?
>
> It's a tool from AWS that provide the process of deploying, managing, and scaling web applications and services, it allows developers to focus on writing code while AWS handles the underlying infrastructure and platform configuration.
> 
> ## 8- Describe the relationship between EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk.
>
> When using Elastic Beanstalk, it automatically creates and manages the required EC2 instances, load balancers, and other resources needed to run the application
>
> ## 9- Name some benefits of using Elastic Beanstalk.
>
> *  supports a variety of platforms and programming languages, including Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, Go, PHP, and .NET, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.
> *  automatically handling the deployment of application code
> *  Auto Scaling and Load Balancing
