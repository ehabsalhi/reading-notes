# Readings: Express, NPM, TDD, CI/CD

> ## A- [An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)
>>  
>> 1-Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter ?
>> 
>>  * middleware is functions that sit between the client side and the server side, allowing for additional processing
>> 
>> 2- Express is the most popular Node web framework.
>> 
>> 3- Express is “unopinionated.” What does that mean?
>> * means that it provides a minimalistic and lightweight structure for building web applications without imposing strict rules
>> 
>> 4- What is a module and why is modularity useful to us as developers?
>> * A module is a JavaScript library-file that you can sue it for import into other code using Node's require() function and it's importante to organize the code into manageable parts
>
> ## B- [What is NPM?](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm)
>> 1- What version of npm are you running on your machine? 9.5.0
>> 2- What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’ into your node project? npm i
>
> ## C- [What is TDD?](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(postType(~'page~'post~'aa_book~'aa_event_session~'aa_experience_report~'aa_glossary~'aa_research_paper~'aa_video)~tags~(~'tdd))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))
>> 1- What are three expected benefits of testing ? 
>>
>> * significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort
>> * these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
>> * TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality.
>>
>> 2- Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.
>>
>> #### individual pitfalls :
>> * forgetting to run tests frequently
>> * writing too many tests at once
>> * writing tests that are too large 
>> * writing overly trivial tests.
>> * writing tests for trivial code.
>>
>> #### Team pitfalls :
>>
>> * partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD
>> * poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time
>> * abandoned test suite (i.e. seldom or never run) – sometimes as a result of poor maintenance, sometimes as a result of team turnover
>> 
>> 3- Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.
>> * Test-driven development helps ensure that the software we build is reliable, works as intended, and doesn't collapse under its own weight , by writing tests, we can catch and fix issues early on.

> ## D- [CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2aNsQKwyOo&ab_channel=AutomationStepbyStep)
>>
>> 1-What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?
>> * It helps identify integration problems early in the development process
>> * CI enables rapid feedback on the quality of code changes, and reducing the time and effort required for debugging and troubleshooting.
>> * organizations can deliver new features, enhancements, and bug fixes to users faster.
>>
>> 2- What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?
>> * Continuous delivery focuses on automating the software release process, making the release process efficient and maintaining a deployable state , and involves continuously integrating code changes, building and testing the software, and packaging it into release-ready artifacts. 
>> * Continuous deployment focuses on automating the deployment process, allowing every successful change to be automatically released to production, and every change that passes the necessary automated tests and quality checks is automatically deployed to the production environment without human intervention
>>
>> 3-Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background ?
>> * GitHub provides tools and features that enable this process, and allows developers to integrate various testing tools and services with their repositories. When a pull request is submitted, these tests are automatically triggered to check if the code changes pass the defined criteria.

> ## E- What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing [the class README](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-02/)?
>> * Increase my knowladge about Node Modules , Express Middleware , TDD and Testing .
