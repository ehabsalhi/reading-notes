>> ## 1- why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module.
>> * DSA and algorithms matter because thay are from the fundamental concept of the computer science and thay provide a crucial role in solving problems
>
>> ## 2-  How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
>> * using base case .
>
>> ## 3- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
>> * It depends on the problem itself and i think we should choose a data structure that provides efficient operations for what the problem need .
>
>>  ## 4-Things I want to know more about .
>> * I want to increase my understanding about data structure and algorithm .
