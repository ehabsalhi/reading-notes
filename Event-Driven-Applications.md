# Event Driven Applications

>  ## 1- What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
>
> We access the EventEmitter class through the events module. Once imported weâ€™ll need to create a new object from the class to start using it.
>
> ## 2- What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
>
> The Object Oriented approach promotes the idea that all behavior of an individual unit (or object) be handled from code within that unit ,
>  OOP allows you to encapsulate data and behavior into objects, making it easier to manage and maintain code.
>
> ## 3- Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.
>
>  Event Driven Programming with Node.js on the backend enables efficient handling  asynchronous tasks, making it well suited for web applications with multiple users and real-time interactions.
