> Text: Displays, styles, and nests strings of text and even handles touch events
>
> Image : Displays different types of images

> ## What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
> 
> React Native solves the need to develop separate codebases for iOS and Android. With React Native, you can write a single codebase in JavaScript and use it to build apps for both platforms.
> 
> ## What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
>
> Components ,  JSX  , State and Props
> 
> ## What solution does expo provide?
>
> Expo is a development platform for React Native that simplifies and accelerates the mobile app development process by providing a range of tools, libraries, and services.
> 
> ## Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the Managed workflow.
> 
> ## What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
>
>  React Native offers more flexibility and customization options but requires more setup and configuration. Expo simplifies development and is an excellent choice for rapid prototyping and projects that can be built within its limitations
> 
> ## Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
>
> online tool for writing, testing, and sharing React Native code and projects.
>  
> ## What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
>
> means transitioning from Expo's managed workflow to the bare workflow, giving more control over React Native project's native code and configuration.
> 
> ## When should you not eject?
>
> if you want to continue benefiting from the simplified development provided by Expo.
> 
> ## Why might you choose to eject?
>
> Ejecting becomes a consideration if you require custom native modules, specific native configurations, or a higher level of control over the app's build process.
