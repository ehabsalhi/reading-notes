> ## 1- What is a Web Socket?
>
> WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
>
> ## 2- Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.
>
> The WebSocket request/response handshake is a process that occurs when a client wants to establish a WebSocket connection with a server. The client sends an initial HTTP request to the server, known as the WebSocket handshake request, containing specific headers. The server validates the request and generates a unique response header. The server sends the WebSocket handshake response back to the client. If the handshake is successful, the WebSocket connection is established, transitioning from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol.
> 
> ## 3- Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a request from that client.
>
> ## 4- What does the event handler io.on() do ?
>
> Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.
>
> ## 5- When would you use Socket.IO and WebSockets?
> 
> Real-time applications , Notifications and alerts
>
> ## -6  TCP - Three-way handshake in details
> 
> The TCP three-way handshake is a process used to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network , It ensures that both the client and server agree to establish a communication channel before exchanging data.
>
> ## 7- OSI Model ?
>
> The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions and protocols used in computer networks. It consists of seven layers, each representing a specific set of functions and responsibilities in the process of network communication.
