# Linked Lists and Big O

## Summary of Big O Notation  : 

Big O notation is used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm or function. This efficiency is evaluated based on :

1- running time or time efficiency : and its the amount of time a function needs to complete.

2- memory space or space efficiency : and its the amount of memory resources a function uses to store data .

and the Big O used  to describe the Worst Case of efficiency an algorithm can have in performing it’s job. 

## Summary of linked lists :

linked list it's a data structure, we use it to store and orgsnize a collection of Nodes tht have elements contain "value" and "pointer" and the pointer refere to the next node in the list.  the first node in the linked list called head , every node except the last one is linked to the next node, while the final node in the list points to be null

we used Linked list because its a dynamic and flexible way for organize the data and its very useful for deletion and adding operation.

## Things I want to know more about :

I need to learn more about data structure and algorithm

## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?

because thay are from the fundamental concept of the computer science and thay provide a crucial role in solving problems
