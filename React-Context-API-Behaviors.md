> #### A reducer helps keep the event handlers short and concise , so you can combine reducer with context to let any component read and update state above it.

> 
> Create two contexts (for state and for dispatch functions).
>
> Provide both contexts from the component that uses the reducer.
> 
> Use either context from components that need to read them.
